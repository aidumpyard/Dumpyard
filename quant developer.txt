Creating a solid quant developer portfolio involves showcasing both your quantitative skills and your ability to implement those ideas in code, especially in a finance-focused context. Here’s a step-by-step roadmap to prepare and build your portfolio:

⸻

1. Build Core Skills

Programming
	•	Primary language: Python (most popular), C++ (for high-frequency/low-latency systems), or Java
	•	Tools & Libraries: NumPy, pandas, SciPy, statsmodels, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch (if using ML)
	•	Version Control: Git + GitHub or GitLab

Mathematics & Statistics
	•	Linear algebra, probability theory, statistics, time series analysis, and stochastic calculus (especially for derivatives or HFT roles)

Finance Knowledge
	•	Pricing of options/derivatives
	•	Market microstructure
	•	Portfolio theory
	•	Risk management
	•	Fixed income concepts (especially yield curves, durations)

⸻

2. Projects to Include in Your Portfolio

Core Project Ideas
	1.	Backtesting Framework: A modular backtesting engine using historical data (e.g., equities, FX, crypto)
	2.	Statistical Arbitrage Model: Cointegration-based pairs trading strategy
	3.	Options Pricing Engine: Implement Black-Scholes, Binomial models, or Monte Carlo simulations
	4.	Volatility Surface Construction: Using market options data to construct implied vol surfaces
	5.	Order Book Simulator: Simulate a limit order book and test market-making strategies
	6.	Machine Learning Models: Predicting stock returns or volatility using ML techniques
	7.	Portfolio Optimization: Mean-variance, CVaR, or Black-Litterman approaches

Bonus Projects
	•	Real-time Strategy Deployment using ccxt (crypto exchanges) or APIs like Alpaca/Interactive Brokers
	•	Data Pipeline Project for streaming and cleaning tick-level data
	•	Monte Carlo Simulations for portfolio risk/option pricing

⸻

3. Presentation & Hosting
	•	GitHub: Clean, well-documented repositories with README files, visualizations, and tests
	•	Blog or Medium: Explain your strategies and results in layman’s terms
	•	Portfolio Website: Showcase your projects, resume, and blog posts
	•	Dashboards (Optional): Use Streamlit or Dash to create interactive strategy demos

⸻

4. Resume and Interview Preparation
	•	Prepare a quant-focused resume (highlight math, coding, and finance projects)
	•	Practice:
	•	Quantitative finance interview questions (brain teasers, math problems)
	•	Coding interviews (Leetcode/QuantConnect challenges)
	•	System design (if going for infra-oriented quant dev roles)

⸻

5. Resources to Learn From
	•	Books:
	•	Quantitative Trading by Ernie Chan
	•	Algorithmic Trading by Ernie Chan
	•	Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives by John Hull
	•	Python for Finance by Yves Hilpisch
	•	Machine Learning for Asset Managers by Marcos López de Prado
	•	Courses:
	•	Coursera: “Financial Engineering and Risk Management” by Columbia
	•	QuantInsti EPAT program
	•	Udemy/YouTube for Python + Finance tutorials
