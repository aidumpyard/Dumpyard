To read an Excel file from a Microsoft shared file, you can use the `Office365-REST-Python-Client` library in Python. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you set it up and read the file:

1. **Install the necessary libraries**:
    ```bash
    pip install Office365-REST-Python-Client pandas
    ```

2. **Authenticate and access the shared file**:
    You'll need your Microsoft account credentials and the URL of the shared file.

3. **Read the file using pandas**:
    Here’s a code example:

    ```python
    from office365.runtime.auth.client_credential import ClientCredential
    from office365.sharepoint.client_context import ClientContext
    from office365.sharepoint.files.file import File
    import pandas as pd
    from io import BytesIO

    # Replace with your credentials and file URL
    client_id = 'your_client_id'
    client_secret = 'your_client_secret'
    site_url = 'https://your_company.sharepoint.com/sites/your_site'
    file_url = '/sites/your_site/Shared Documents/your_file.xlsx'

    # Authenticate
    ctx = ClientContext(site_url).with_credentials(ClientCredential(client_id, client_secret))

    # Read the file
    response = File.open_binary(ctx, file_url)
    bytes_file_obj = BytesIO()
    bytes_file_obj.write(response.content)
    bytes_file_obj.seek(0)

    # Load into pandas DataFrame
    df = pd.read_excel(bytes_file_obj)

    # Display the DataFrame
    print(df)
    ```

### Steps Explained:
1. **Install Libraries**: The `Office365-REST-Python-Client` library is used for interacting with SharePoint and OneDrive. `pandas` is used for handling the Excel file.
2. **Authenticate**: Use the `ClientCredential` method with your client ID and secret to authenticate with your SharePoint site.
3. **Access the File**: Use the `File.open_binary` method to read the file from the given URL.
4. **Read with Pandas**: Convert the binary response to a `BytesIO` object and read it into a pandas DataFrame.

Make sure to replace placeholder values like `your_client_id`, `your_client_secret`, `your_site`, and `your_file.xlsx` with your actual values.
